I"À<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m Donghyeon Won and I usually go by DH, as people usually forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY">how to pronounce my name</a> quickly.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m originally from Seoul, Korea but Iâ€™m currently based in Los Angels, CA.</p>

<p>I am currently at <a href="https://motional.com/">Motional</a>â€™s Computer Vision team. I write codes to train vision perception mdodels and deploy them on the vehicles. (The latter is more difficult, IMO)</p>

<p>My current interest lies in self-driving cars, sustainablity, startups, and etcetra. If you share the similar interests, feel free to connect me via linked in.</p>
