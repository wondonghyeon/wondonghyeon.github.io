*Half-Earth: Our Planet's Fight for Life* is a book written by an esteemed biologist, E.O. Wilson, which I had the pleasure of reading a few months ago. I truly found it inspiring and highly recommend everyone to read it. The book mainly focuses on explaining how diverse, intricate and delicate our ecosystem is. I mean, we all know that the nature is very complex right? I thought I knew too. However, after reading the book, I felt embarassed. This book served as some kind of wake-up call for me. Here are my thoughts and key takeaways, along with some inspiring quotes.

* *"The biosphere does not belong to us; we belong to it"* - This is my favorite quote from the book. If more individuals adopt this perspective, the world will be a better place to live. 
    > Leaders in biodiversity research and conservation have long understood that the surviving wildlands of the world are not art museums.

    > What do we receive from them? The stabilization of the global environment they provide and their very existence are the gifts they give to us. We are their stewards, not their owners.

* Nature is far more complex and sophisticated than we can imagine. We can't fully understand the system so we should be extra careful when we make any decision that can impact the environment. Perhaps, it might be wiser to err on the side of refraining from taking action altogether for most cases.
    > Can the planet be run as a true spaceship by one intelligent species? Surely we would be foolish to take such a large and dangerous gamble.

    > We have only one planet and we are allowed only one such experiment. Why make a world-threatening and unnecessary gamble if a safe option is open?


Also, there is a cool [project page](https://www.half-earthproject.org/) that I highly recommend checking out.
