I read a little more than last year (29 in total, compared to 26 in 2024). I took a few months off from work this year so I had more time to read. I wish I had read more, but I’m still happy with the number. I hope I can keep this momentum going in 2026 but the new job is quite demanding, so we’ll see.

## Book Stats

I read 15 non-fiction and 14 fiction books this year. I was too lazy to make visualizations again, but I don't think there are significant differences compared to last year.

## My Favorites

If I had to pick one fiction and one nonfiction book from this year, I’d go with *Orbital: A Novel* and *The Catalyst: RNA and the Quest to Unlock Life's Deepest Secrets*.

- **Orbital**: One might think this is just another sci-fi novel by looking at the title, but it’s actually a very meditative, philosophical, and emotional exploration of human nature and society. My favorite part of the book is where the characters talk about Velasquez's painting "Las Meninas" and how the dog is the only being in the painting that is truly free.

- **The Catalyst: RNA and the Quest to Unlock Life's Deepest Secrets**: I didn't take many biology courses in schools and I always felt embarrassed that I didn’t really know what the “central dogma” was. Thanks to this book, I think I finally undertand what it means! To be honest, I’m pretty biased toward this book, since history/philosophy of science is one of my favorite topics.

*Gratitude*, *아주 희미한 빛으로도*, *흰*, *Siddhartha*, *Death in a Shallow Pond*, *The Fall* were also great reads.

I didn’t really like *Comfort Crisis* and *Not the End of the World* as much as I expected. While I appreciated their broad messages, I often felt that some of the claims leaned on oversimplified readings of statistics and research, drawing conclusions that felt a bit too confident. I might also be biased, since I “read” them as audiobooks.
