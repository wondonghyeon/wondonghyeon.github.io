To be honest, I don't read a lot of books and I know it's a shame. I'll try to read more from now on. 

FYI, I read books mostly in Korean since reading a bunch of English words is still a bit stressful for me. I read the below two books also in Korean. 🙂

## Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know - Adam Grant (싱크 어게인 - 아담 그랜트)

My takeaway from this book is that we should always be humble and keep doubting our beliefs. We are sometimes too confident about things we don't know very well. 

***"Arrogance leaves us blind to our weaknesses. Humility is a reflective lens: it helps us see them clearly. Confident humility is a corrective lens: it enables us to overcome those weaknesses."***

***"오만함은 자기 약점을 바라보지 못하게 눈을 가린다. 겸손함은 반사용 렌즈라서 자기 약점을 선명하게 바라볼 수 있게 도와준다. 확신에 찬 겸손함은 교정용 렌즈라서 그 약점을 극복하게 돕는다."***

## The Theory of Light and Matter - Andrew J. Porter (빛과 물질에 관한 이론 - 앤드루 포터)

This book easily became one of my favorite fictions. 

We are not superheroes and sometimes there are life problems we can't solve. However, our lives don't end there - we just live with those unsolved problems. 

***"And it takes a while, almost several minutes, before we finally turn around and look at what we've done."***, **Azul**

***"It was only in my own mind, and perhaps in my heart, that I understood what I was doing to be a betrayal."***, **The Theory of Light and Matter**

***"그리고 얼마의 시간이 흐른 뒤에야, 그렇게 몇 분여를 보낸 후에야, 우리는 마침내 뒤로 돌아 우리의 지나간 행동을 직면한다."***, **[아술] 중에서**

***"나는 행동이 배신임을 아는 것은 나 자신의 마음, 어쩌면 나 자신의 가슴뿐이었다."***, **[빛과 물질에 관한 이론] 중에서**
