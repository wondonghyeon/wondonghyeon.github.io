Somehow, 2024 turned out to be the year I went to the most concerts—and read the most books too. Here's a look at all the concerts I made it to this year.

## Bek Hyunjin  

*Seoul, January*  

I came across Bek Hyunjin last year, and I wish I had discovered him sooner. The concert was held at a bar—a very casual one—with a small stage. There were probably fewer than 100 people in the audience. Kim Oki was also there, casually playing saxophone as part of the band.

## Mitski  

*Los Angeles, March*  

I like Mitski, but I honestly don’t know her music super well. I knew fewer than 10 of her songs beforehand, but it didn’t matter. Her performance was so inspiring and artsy—if I’m exaggerating a bit, it felt like a piece of performing art. One thing I noticed: most of her audience seemed pretty young. I felt like I was the oldest person there.

## Soccer Mommy  

*Los Angeles, June*  

Soccer Mommy is one of my favorite bands (though I have thousands of favorite bands...). This was my second time seeing her perform, and unlike the first show I saw at the Wiltern, this one was at [a very small venue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Forever_Cemetery). Sophie Allison performed solo, without her band, which made it even more intimate. Then, out of nowhere, Phoebe Bridgers joined her on stage and sang a song or two with Sophie. That was such a vibe.

## The Volunteers  

*Los Angeles, July*  

I love Yerin Baek. I saw her live two years ago and was impressed by how good she was on stage. [The Volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Volunteers_(South_Korean_band)) were just as good and fun!

## Bleachers  

*Los Angeles, September*  

This might have been the most fun concert I went to this year. Jack Antonoff is such a rockstar. It was interesting to see him perform at the Greek Theatre with a big band and a more polished stage setup. Back in 2017, when I saw Bleachers for the first time, it was in [a much smaller venue](https://www.instagram.com/theglasshousepomona?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==), and tickets were only $30. It’s wild to see how big he’s become since then.

## Lee Juck  

*Seoul, October*  

It was an incredible experience to hear this legendary artist live. The concert had a much calmer vibe compared to the shows I usually go to, and the audience was a little older too. Still, it was fun.

## Joni Mitchell & The Joni Jam  

*Los Angeles, October*  

I still can’t believe I saw her perform live. I’ll be bragging to my grandchildren that I got to hear her sing *Big Yellow Taxi* and *Both Sides Now*. There were surprise guests, including Elton John, Meryl Streep, and Jon Batiste. When Elton John came on stage, I thought I was dreaming. 

It’s unbelievable how energetic she is in her 80s. What must it feel like to have tens of thousands of people come to see you perform at that age? What a life she’s lived!

## Thom Yorke  

*Tokyo, November*  

If someone asks me, “What kind of music do you listen to?” my answer is always Radiohead. Among my thousands of favorite bands, I can confidently say they’re my number one. Seeing them live has always been at the top of my bucket list, and now I can half-cross it off.  

The concert was awe-striking—I haven’t experienced anything like it before. It felt like stepping into a completely different world.

## Andre 3000  

*Tokyo, November*  

I saw him perform at Blue Note Tokyo, and it was another awe-striking experience. He played more than 10 instruments, and everything he performed was improvised (according to Andre). At one point, he spoke in a language none of us understood for a few minutes. Afterward, he told us he had made it up. It was funny but also strangely inspiring.
