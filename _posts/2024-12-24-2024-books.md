Here are the books I read in 2024. I finished 26 in total. This year, I started reading every morning before work—one of the very few things I’m proud of in 2024.

## Book Stats

15 out of 26 were non-finctions and 11 were fictions. Exactly half (13 out of 26) were science-related. 

To make it fun, I visualized some stats from this year’s reading:

## My Favorites

Among the 26 books, *Naming Nature*, *On the Move*, *Under A White Sky*, and *희랍어 시간* were my favorites. 

- **Naming Nature**: Offers great insights into how limited our perception and understanding of the world. 
- **On the Move**: Very inspiring. How can someone live with such endless passion? It left me questioning whether I’m missing something in my own life.
- **Under A White Sky**: It’s almost impossible to predict the consequences of human intervention in nature. Yet, with the urgency of the climate crisis, such actions are sometimes necessary. What should we do, and how should we do it? This quote encapsulates the book’s essence:
  > His preferred drug analogy for the technology is chemotherapy. No one in his right mind would undergo chemotherapy were better options available. "We live in a world," he has said, "where deliberately dimming the fucking sun might be less risky than not doing it."
- **희랍어 시간**: What an honor to read a Nobel Prize-winning work in my native language.
