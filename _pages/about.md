Hi! My full name is Donghyeon but I usually go by DH, as many people often have a hard time figuring out [how to pronounce my name correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY). I'm originally from Seoul, Korea and currently based in Los Angeles, CA.

I'm a Computer Vision engineer at [Motional](https://motional.com/), a self-driving car company. I write codes to train vision perception models and deploy them on autonomous vehicles (The latter is more difficult, IMO).

I'm interested in self-driving cars, sustainability, start-ups, and playing tennis. If you share similar interests, feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn.
