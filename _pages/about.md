Hi! My full name is Donghyeon but I usually go by DH, as many people usually have hard time figuring out [how to pronounce my name correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY). I'm originally from Seoul, Korea and I'm currently based in Los Angeles, CA.

I'm a Copmuter Vision engineer at [Motional](https://motional.com/), a self-driving car company. I write codes to train vision perception models and deploy them on autonomous vehicles. (The latter is more difficult, IMO). 

I'm interested in self-driving cars, sustainablity, start-ups, and playing tennis. If you share similar interests, feel free to connect me via LinkedIn.
