# About Me

I'm Donghyeon Won and I usually go by DH, as people usually forget [how to pronounce my name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY) quickly.

I'm originally from Seoul, Korea but I'm currently based in Los Angels, CA.

I am currently at [Motional](https://motional.com/)'s Computer Vision team. I write codes to train vision perception mdodels and deploy them on the vehicles. (The latter is more difficult, IMO)


My current interest lies in self-driving cars, sustainablity, startups, and etcetra. If you share the similar interests, feel free to connect me via linked in.
