Hi! I'm Donghyeon ([pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY)). I'm originally from Seoul, Korea, and currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I'm a Perception / Computer Vision engineer on NVIDIA's autonomous vehicle team, working on onboard 3D perception models. Before that, I spent several years on [Motional](https://motional.com/)'s Perception team.

I'm passionate about self-driving cars, sustainability, startups, and tennis. If we share similar interests, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).
