Hi! I'm Donghyeon ([pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY)). I'm originally from Seoul, Korea, and currently based in Los Angeles, CA.

I'm a Computer Vision engineer currently on a career break. I previously worked at [Motional](https://motional.com/), a self-driving car company, where I led and contributed to various Perception projects.

I'm passionate about self-driving cars, sustainability, start-ups, and tennis. If we share similar interests, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).
