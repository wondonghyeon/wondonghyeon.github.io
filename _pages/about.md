Hi! I'm Donghyeon and I usually go by DH, as many people usually have hard time figuring out [how to pronounce my name correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivJ2rq4QDNY).

I'm originally from Seoul, Korea and I'm currently based in Los Angels, CA.

I am currently at [Motional](https://motional.com/)'s Computer Vision team. I write codes to train vision perception models and deploy them on the autonomous vehicles. (The latter is more difficult, IMO)

My current interests lie in self-driving cars, sustainablity, startups, and etc. If you share similar interests, feel free to connect me via LinkedIn.
